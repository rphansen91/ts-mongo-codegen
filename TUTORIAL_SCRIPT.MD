# Generate All CRUD and Pagination Operations (10 minutes or less)

GraphQL and its schema driven development methodology lends it's self nicely for code generation. After creating dozens of MongoDB backed GraphQL Apis over the past few years their are quite a few patterns that have stood out at least when.

## **C**REATE

## Insert Resource

## Insert Many Resources

## **R**EAD

### Find Resource By ObjectID

### Find Many Resources By ObjectIDs

### Paginated and Sorted Queries

### Filtered Totals

## **U**PDATE

### Update Resource By ObjectID

### Update Many Resources By ObjectIDs

## **D**ELETE

### Remove Resource By ObjectID

### Remove Many Resources By ObjectIDs

With these basic yet useful patters generated it allows the developer to focus on how the end user interacts with the data. 

Less time as a result is spent doing error prone tasks like manipulating data types, and more time is spent delivering value.
